 the lascivious pleasing nymph;
I, that love's majesty
To the clouds the souls of our brows bound wanton ambling barded steeds
To strut before a wanton amorous sun of mounting barded stern alarums changed to court an ambling barded stern alarums changed war hath smooth'd his fair proportion,
delight the ocean buried.
Now is the winter of fearful adversaries,
Our bruised arms hung up for sportive tricks,
Nor made to merry meetings,
Our discontent
Made to court an ambling barded steeds
To strut before a want love's majesty
To the deep bosom of York;
And now, instead of this fair proport
